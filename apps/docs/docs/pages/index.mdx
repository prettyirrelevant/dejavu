# DEJAVU

A social deduction party game where memory meets deception.

## What is DEJAVU?

DEJAVU is a multiplayer party game where players try to identify who among them actually witnessed a strange event, and who is faking it.

Every round, an AI generates a quirky scenario—something like *"a guy in a Spider-Man costume at the grocery store"* or *"an old lady at a coffee shop named Darkwolf."* One or two players become **Witnesses** and receive the real details. Everyone else becomes **Imposters** who must fabricate convincing answers from vague hints.

## The Core Loop

::::steps

### Everyone reads the scenario

A shared memory prompt sets the scene for all players.

### Witnesses get details, Imposters get hints

Witnesses see specific fragments (colors, numbers, quotes). Imposters only get vague hints.

### Answer the question

All players privately answer a specific question about the memory.

### Discuss via voice chat

Interrogate each other. Look for inconsistencies. Defend your answer.

### Vote on who witnessed it

Cast your vote for who you think is a real witness.

Witnesses score points when they're *not* identified. Imposters score when they correctly identify a witness. Trust no one.
