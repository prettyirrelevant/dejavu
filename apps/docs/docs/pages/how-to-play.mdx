# How to Play

DEJAVU is a social deduction game for 3-8 players. One or two of you saw something strange. The rest are making it up. Find the real witness before the imposters fool everyone.

## Roles

### Witness

You have the real memory. You know:
- Exact colors, numbers, and details
- Specific quotes from the scenario  
- The small absurd details that make the story real

:::tip[Witness Strategy]
Answer accurately, but not *too* perfectly. If you're too precise, imposters will spot you.
:::

### Imposter

You only got vague hints. You know:
- The general vibe of what happened
- That "something unexpected" occurred
- Just enough to make up plausible lies

:::tip[Imposter Strategy]
Fabricate convincing details. Watch for anyone who knows too much—they might be a witness.

## Game Phases

::::steps

### Memory (15 seconds)

Everyone sees the same scenario prompt. Something like:

> "You were at the grocery store when a guy in a full Spider-Man costume walked past you pushing a cart. He stopped, pointed at your cart, and gave you a thumbs up."

Read carefully. This is the shared context everyone works from.

### Roles (20 seconds)

Roles are secretly assigned:
- **Witnesses** see 4 specific memory fragments (exact colors, numbers, quotes)
- **Imposters** see 4 vague hints (general descriptions, no specifics)

Memorize what you can. You'll need it.

### Details (45 seconds)

Everyone privately answers a specific question about the memory:

> "What shoes was he wearing?"

Witnesses know: "Bright orange Crocs."  
Imposters must guess: "Sneakers? Sandals?"

All answers are submitted anonymously, then revealed to everyone.

### Questions (45 seconds)

The interrogation phase. Everyone's answers are displayed.

- Discuss via voice chat
- Ask follow-up questions
- Look for inconsistencies
- Watch how people defend their answers

:::info
When ready, any player can call for a vote. Once 50% of players call for voting, the voting phase begins—or it auto-starts when time runs out.
:::

### Voting (15 seconds)

Vote for who you think is a Witness. You cannot vote for yourself.

Everyone votes simultaneously. No discussion during this phase.

### Results (15 seconds)

The truth is revealed:
- Who the witnesses really were
- What the real memory fragments said
- How everyone voted
- Points earned this round

Then the next round begins with a fresh scenario.

## Strategy Tips

:::details[For Witnesses]
- **Don't be too perfect.** If your answer exactly matches the fragment, you'll stand out.
- **Add small errors.** Real memories are imperfect.
- **Act confused.** Ask questions about other answers, even if you know the truth.
- **Deflect suspicion.** Point out inconsistencies in others' answers.
:::

:::details[For Imposters]
- **Commit fully.** Hesitation is suspicious.
- **Be specific.** Vague answers read as uncertain.
- **Pick believable details.** "Blue sneakers" sounds more real than "shoes, I think."
- **Watch reactions.** When someone answers with unusual confidence, they might know something.
:::

:::details[For Everyone]
- **Listen to tone.** How someone defends their answer matters as much as the answer itself.
- **Form theories.** Don't just vote randomly—explain your reasoning.
- **Have fun.** The best games happen when everyone commits to the bit.
